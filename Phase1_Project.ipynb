    "Melbourne has a very active housing market as demand for housing throughout the city is usually well above the supply. For this reason, a model that can accurately predict a house's selling price in Melbourne would have many real-world uses. For instance, real estate agents can provide better service to their customers using this predictive model. Likewise, banks lending out money to home buyers can better estimate the financial aspects of this home loan. Perhaps more importantly as potential home buyers, we as individuals can better figure out if we are being ripped off or we are getting a good deal provided that our predictive model is a reliable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the main objective of this project is two-fold: (1) predict the price of a house sold in Melbourne based on publicly available features of the house, and (2) which features seem to be the best predictors of the house sale price. A secondary objective is to perform some exploratory data analysis by basic descriptive statistics & data visualisation plots to gain some insight into the patterns and relationships existing in the data subsequent to some data cleaning & preprocessing, which is the subject of this Phase 1 report.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we make the important assumption that rows in our dataset are not correlated. That is, we assume that house price observations are independent of one another in this dataset. Of course, this is not a very realistic assumption, however, this assumption allows us to circumvent time series aspects of the underlying dynamics of house prices and also to resort to rather classical predictive models such as multiple linear regression."

    "Accurate prediction of house prices has many practical applications for all stakeholders; including buyers, sellers, banks, and real-estate agencies. Without a doubt, a model that can reliably predict a house's actual sale price would be indispensable  for healthy functioning of the housing market. Our goal in this project is to investigate if we can come up with a reliable model for predicting house prices using the Melbourne House Prices dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Phase I of this project, we undertook the tasks of data cleaning & preprocessing and data visualisation. First we decided to drop two variables which we considered to be not useful for predictive modelling, namely the `Postcode` and `Bedroom2` variables. We also checked the data for any missing values and outliers, and we decided to remove any rows containing such data quality issues. There was not much cleaning needed, as the data seemed to be relatively clean to begin with. Furthermore, we sampled the data to get only 5000 random rows to save time when running models in the second phase of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generated several visualisations in order to explore the data. Using the explanatory variables, we clearly see that Southern Metropolitan region has the highest count of selling Melbourne houses. During the years 2016 and 2017, the house prices in Melbourne only have a slight difference in prices which we can see that 2017 has more houses sold than 2016. Furthermore, in the years 2016 and 2017, the unit/ duplex house prices tend to be lower when it is closer to CBD than houses and townhouses. Therefore, Melbourne house prices tend to fluctuate more when people buy houses from popular region areas or CBD in Melbourne. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also observed that some of the numerical data are skewed, including the target feature, Price. Scaling/ transformation of the data will be needed to address this issue. We have seen that house types, distance from CBD, and number of rooms are few of the most significant features in determining the house price. However, further analysis needs be done in order to identify any further relationships. "
