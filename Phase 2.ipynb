    "This report continues on the Phase 1 report. For the Phase 1 report, we cleaned and preprocessed the Facebook metrics dataset. During this process, we decided to remove data that we decided was unnecessary for statistical analysis and modelling. The data that was dropped was the `category` column since it was redundant, and we also dropped any missing values in the dataset. The dataset contained 500 observations in total out of which 5 were dropped due to missing values. After the data preprocessing, the dataset contains 18 variables and 495 observations. We also changed the `paid` column to have values that were `strings` since it is a binary categorical variable, and for the ease of handling the data. We also represented the data using a variety of graphs so as to visualise the data. \n",
